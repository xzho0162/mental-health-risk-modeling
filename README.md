# Mental Health Risk & Happiness Prediction (Machine Learning)

## Overview
This project develops machine learning models to predict mental health risk and happiness levels using large-scale survey data (~70 behavioral and demographic variables).

The work combines regression and classification modelling techniques to generate accurate predictions and identify key drivers influencing psychological wellbeing.

**Key Achievement:**
- Top 15% ranking in a regression competition
- Top 25% ranking in a classification competition

## Business / Real-World Context
Mental health analytics is increasingly important for healthcare, policy design, and social research. Accurate predictive models can help:

- Identify high-risk individuals earlier  
- Support targeted interventions  
- Improve resource allocation  

This project simulates a real-world predictive analytics workflow used in data science roles.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of survey responses capturing psychological, behavioral, and socioeconomic factors.

Examples of predictors include:

- Income levels  
- Emotional wellbeing indicators  
- Sense of purpose  
- Social engagement  

~70 variables were engineered and evaluated for predictive power.

## Methodology

### Feature Engineering
Feature engineering significantly improved model performance:

- Reduced cross-validated RMSE from **9.25 → 7.44**
- Demonstrated that engineered features outperform raw survey data

### Models Implemented
- Multiple Linear Regression  
- Random Forest  
- Ensemble approaches  
- Classification models for anxiety prediction  

Cross-validation was applied to ensure model robustness.
